# chessGameFX by Team 1

This is the basic chess game implemented in JavaFX. All of the pieces should behave just as regular chess would. Extended ruleset with En Passant, Pawn Promotion, and Castling are implemented. Players can choose their names, but names are defaulted to "Black" and "White". Each player has a 5 minute timer. Like normal chess, when the board is in check, the player is only allowed to make moves that exit check, and if there are no available moves to exit check, the board enters checkmate, and the game is over.

Utilizes Java8 and JavaFX
No real reqs but if your computer struggles with AI, lower the difficulty.
